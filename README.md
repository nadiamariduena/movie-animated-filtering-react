### The Api ü•≠

#### I will be using the same API (from the previous tutorial)

<br>

- Go to the api website [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and look in the side bar, for[ SEARCH ](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-companies)

- Then click again in side bar, for **search the movie**

##### get/search/movie

<br>

#### üî¥ Remember:

> **You need to request the API key**, you will have to fill a form about why do and in what do you want to use, after that you will receive your api in your email, or just refresh the page

<br>

#### Once you have the API:

- Create a **.env.local** and **store your API** there like so:

```javascript
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=long api code here
```

<br>

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è After you add the API, restart the app.
